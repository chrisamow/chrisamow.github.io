Couldn't help but noticing some sweet looking vue controls out there...
  
nice toggle switch, i would like to add a hover or tooltip

testing gui, with upvote/downvote - the html seems so clear and beautiful

datagrid - yes!!  recurring theme, i love datagrids, i like the edit capability setting

datagrid with some built-in ajax stuff going on

show/hide password - good simple one to look at

interesting shopping cart, the items thing in the corner was more intuitive than i expected

filter list - really more just sample code, more usable case insensitive
