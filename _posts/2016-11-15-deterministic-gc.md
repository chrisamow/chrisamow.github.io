I wish python had something like the [Prompt Collection](https://github.com/qorelanguage/qore/wiki/Prompt-Collection) built in - it would make us C++ guys so happy!
  
[PEP 343](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0343/) and the context managers need to account for larger scopes.
  
oh well, there is always python4 i guess :)
