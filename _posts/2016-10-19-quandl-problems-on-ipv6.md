## slowwwwdown...

Over the last month I noticed an order of magnitude slowdown in getting pretty modestly sized datasets (forex) using their API via the up-to-date Quandl module.

Their tech support was helpful and details are here:

They are working with AWS for a solution.  For now, need to disable IPv6 (on linux)
